        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Data Processors</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Google/Firebase Services</h3>
        <p>Re-Source uses the following Google Firebase services, making Google a data processor for Re-Source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> For user account management</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Firestore:</strong> For database storage</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Storage:</strong> For image storage</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> For crash reporting and analytics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Google Firebase's privacy practices are governed by their privacy policy, which you can review at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>

        <h3>4.2 Google's Role</h3>
        <p>Google Firebase acts as a service provider and data processor on behalf of Re-Source. Google processes your data according to their terms of service and privacy policies, and maintains certifications for data security and privacy compliance.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Websites and HTTP Requests</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Metadata Fetching</h3>
        <p>When you save a URL/link in Re-Source, the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Makes a <strong>direct HTTP request</strong> to the provided URL from your device</li>
            <li>Parses the webpage HTML to extract metadata including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image)</li>
                    <li>Standard meta tags (description, title)</li>
                    <li>Page title and preview images</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Does NOT use a proxy server</strong> - your device connects directly to the target website</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Privacy Implications</h3>
        <p>When fetching metadata:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The target website may log your IP address and device information</li>
            <li>The target website's privacy policy applies to this interaction</li>
            <li>Re-Source does not control or have visibility into what data third-party websites collect</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> When you explicitly authorize data sharing</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With Google Firebase as described in Section 4</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request</li>
            <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> To protect the rights, property, or safety of Re-Source, our users, or the public</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Location and Infrastructure</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 Firebase Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored on Google Firebase's cloud infrastructure. Firebase operates data centers in multiple regions worldwide, and your data may be stored and processed in any of these locations based on Google's infrastructure configuration.</p>

        <h3>7.2 International Data Transfers</h3>

        <h3>8.4 App Uninstallation</h3>
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Simply uninstalling the Re-Source app does NOT delete your cloud-stored data.

        <ul>
            <li>Some data may remain in backup systems for a limited period according to Firebase's backup policies</li>
            <li>Firebase may retain certain data according to their data retention policies</li>
            <li>Crash logs and analytics data may be retained temporarily according to Firebase Crashlytics retention policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.3 Inactive Accounts</h3>
        <p>We do not automatically delete inactive accounts. Your data will remain in Firebase until you delete your account.</p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>Re-Source is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
